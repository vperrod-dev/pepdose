# pepdose

A peptide dose-tracking PWA. Plan protocols, log injections, track vials, and reason about
half-lives, reconstitution, and stacking — all stored locally on your device.

**Live:** https://vperrod.github.io/pepdose/

## Features

- **Protocols** — create from templates or any peptide, then fully edit a running protocol:
  per-peptide dose, length, frequency, time of day, and start date. Pause/resume/delete.
- **Smart scheduling** — the engine auto-generates every injection. Supports:
  - **Auto-titration** — GLP-1s step the dose up on a week ladder automatically (e.g.
    retatrutide `2→4→6→9→12mg`).
  - **Phased schedules + protocol variants** — peptides like GLOW carry several selectable
    cycle protocols (e.g. *daily → 5×/week → off*); pick one and the calendar reproduces the
    exact taper, including weekday-only (`5×/week`) cadence.
- **Editing regenerates safely** — changing a protocol rebuilds its upcoming doses while
  preserving everything already logged/skipped/missed.
- **Protocol journey** — tap a protocol (from the Protocols list or a Dashboard card) to see
  its full timeline: every dose grouped by week, status (done/upcoming/missed/skipped),
  injection site, and titration step-ups. Tap any dose to log or edit it; logged doses stay
  editable (dose, time, site, notes). "Manage" holds edit/pause/delete. Each week shows the
  **expected experience guide** for that week inline (what to expect, tips), and an **outcome
  overlay** charts a health marker (weight/sleep/energy/mood) across the protocol so you can
  see if it's working.
- **Find a protocol** — pick a goal (healing, weight loss, growth hormone, etc.) and get the
  matching peptides + documented **synergy stacks**, one tap to a prefilled new protocol.
- **Titration coach** — the Dashboard flags your next upcoming dose step-up ("Week 4 — step up
  to 4mg on Mon"), computed from the titration ladder. Rule-based, works offline.
- **Dose logging** — log actual quantity, time, injection site, and notes; reschedule or skip.
  Pick the site by tapping a **body map** (recency-colored so overused zones show red); a
  fresh log defaults to the *most-rested* zone. Optionally flag a **site reaction**
  (redness/lump/pain/bruise). Logged rows show the *actual* recorded site.
- **Injection map & zone volume** — an Insights view showing where doses landed: the body map
  colored by recency plus a per-zone table of injection count + last-used over a 30/90-day
  window, hottest zones first. Surfaces overuse (lipohypertrophy risk) and flags zones with
  logged reactions. For daily abdomen dosers, an opt-in **clock-method dial** logs precise
  12-position sites around the navel.
- **Calendar** — tap any scheduled dose to log, reschedule, or skip
- **Peptide library** — peptide database with dosing data, plus stacking rules
- **Calculators** — reconstitution calculator (with **IU→mg** converter for IU-dosed compounds
  like HGH/HCG) and half-life decay charts
- **Vial inventory** — track stock on hand, with a **run-out date forecast** from your dosing cadence
- **Insights & health markers** — trends and self-reported markers over time, including
  **body measurements** (waist, chest, arms, thighs, etc. in cm) logged alongside weight/body-fat
  and plotted on the same trend chart to track physical progress
- **Experience guides** — week-by-week timelines, side effects, and red flags (community + clinical sourced)
- **Two users (Victor / Nadia)** — a shared-device model. Every protocol, dose, vial, and
  health marker belongs to a user; creation forms carry a Victor/Nadia picker (remembering your
  last choice). All screens show both users at once, each item badged with its owner, plus a
  **Both / Victor / Nadia** filter chip in the header to narrow the view (charts respect it).
  Onboarding and settings are shared.
- **Export / import** — back up and restore all data
- **Offline-first PWA** — installable, works without a connection

## Stack

React 19 · TypeScript · Vite · Tailwind CSS 4 · React Router 7 · Recharts · IndexedDB (via `idb`) · date-fns · lucide-react

All data lives in IndexedDB in the browser — nothing is sent to a server.

## How scheduling works

- `src/data/peptides.ts` — the peptide database. A peptide's `dosing` can carry a `titration`
  ladder (auto dose step-ups) and/or `protocolVariants` (named phased cycles, each a list of
  `SchedulePhase` week-ranges + cadence).
- `src/utils/scheduleEngine.ts` — `generateSchedule()` turns a config into dated doses. Fixed
  cadences (`daily`/`eod`/`weekly`/`biweekly`/`custom`) use per-cadence loops; peptides with
  `schedulePhases` use a day-by-day phased generator (`5x_week` = weekdays). `summarizePhases()`
  / `phasesTotalWeeks()` are shared helpers for the UI.
- `src/pages/NewProtocol.tsx` / `src/pages/Protocols.tsx` — create and edit flows. Editing
  regenerates upcoming doses (`deleteUpcomingDosesFrom` + `saveScheduledDoses` in
  `src/db/operations.ts`) and preserves logged history. `Protocols.tsx` also renders the
  journey timeline, joining `getScheduledDosesForProtocol` with `getDoseLogsForProtocol` so
  logged rows show the real `injectionSite`. Per-dose logging/editing reuses
  `src/components/DoseActionSheet.tsx` (`logDose` for new, `updateDoseLog` for edits).

## How injection tracking works

- `src/data/injectionSites.ts` — the single source of truth for injection sites (8 subq zones
  with SVG coordinates + 12 abdomen clock positions). `BodyMapSVG`, `DoseActionSheet`, and
  `scheduleEngine` all read from it.
- `src/utils/injectionStats.ts` — pure recency/volume helpers. `zoneStats()` aggregates logs
  into per-zone counts + last-used; `daysSinceByLabel()` drives the map colors and folds
  clock-method picks back into the abdomen zones; `mostRestedLabel()` picks the default log
  site. `src/pages/InjectionMap.tsx` renders the stats view.
- Sites are stored as label strings on each `DoseLog` (no schema migration); the map bridges
  label↔id for coloring.

## How protocol guidance works

- `src/data/experienceTimelines.ts` — `getCurrentWeekGuide(peptideId, week)` feeds the inline
  week-by-week guide in the journey.
- `src/utils/titrationCoach.ts` — `nextTitrationStep(doses, today)` finds the next upcoming
  `isTitrationStepUp` dose (flagged by the schedule engine) for the Dashboard coach. Pure, no AI.
- `src/utils/goalPicker.ts` — `peptidesForGoal(category)` + `synergyStacksFor(category)` power the
  `/find` picker (only `synergy` stacks surface). Picks navigate to `NewProtocol` with
  `preselectPeptideIds` in router state.
- The outcome overlay reuses the `HealthMarkers` recharts pattern with `getHealthMarkers(start, end)`.

## How the two-user model works

- `src/data/users.ts` — the two fixed users (`Victor`, `Nadia`), their badge colors, and the
  `getLastOwner`/`setLastOwner` preference (localStorage `pepdose-last-owner`).
- Every owned record (`UserProtocol`, `ScheduledDose`, `DoseLog`, `Vial`, `HealthMarker`) carries
  an `owner`. A DB **v1→v2** migration in `src/db/schema.ts` backfills all pre-existing data to
  `Victor`; `importData` defaults owner-less records from old backups the same way.
- `saveScheduledDoses(doses, owner)` stamps owner at the save boundary, keeping `scheduleEngine`
  owner-free (it returns `DraftDose` = owner-less doses). Logged doses inherit their scheduled
  dose's owner.
- `src/context/ViewFilterContext.tsx` holds the `Both / Victor / Nadia` view filter (persisted,
  default *Both*); `useOwnerFilter()` / `filterByOwner()` filter any owned list. `UserFilterChip`
  (header) sets it; `UserPicker` (forms) assigns owner; `UserBadge` labels each item.

## Deploy

Pushing to `main` triggers `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which builds and publishes to
GitHub Pages. The Vite `base` is set to `/pepdose/` to match the Pages path.
